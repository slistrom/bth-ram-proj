About this site
=========================

This site was made as the final project in a course called ramverk1 in the program webbprogrammering at Blekinge tekniska högskola.

It is a site that depict a forum about a certain topic, in this case it is a forum based on questions regarding cars. The basic functionality is that individuals can create user account and ask questions about cars. Users can then answer these questions and also comment both questions and answers. When a user post a question it is also possible to tag the question so that other users can search for questions by looking at common tags and see which quesitons are related to that specific tag. 

Posting a question, answer or a comment requires users to be logged in to the site. However it is possible to view questions, answers tags and users without having to register and log in to the site.
